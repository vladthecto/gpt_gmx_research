(image 1)\n\njune 19th, 9:30 pm et, we receive the rba meeting minutes of its june meeting. here is the summary of that meeting\n\ninflation in australia is at 7%, still high despite reaching its peak. the central bank is raising interest rates to restore confidence and bring inflation back to the target range. high inflation affects people's lives, damages the economy, and worsens inequality. the labor market has eased, and while wages have grown, household spending is slowing. uncertainties in the global economy and housing market add to the challenges. the central bank will closely monitor the situation and take necessary actions to return inflation to the target range.\n\nwhat traders will need to consider is what does the rba reveal in its meeting minutes that would have led to the hike.\n\nhere is what some investment banks expect for the rba to do in the future, which might give some further hints as to what was discussed in the meeting.\n\njune 7th - goldman sachs\ngoldman sachs now expects rba to hike rate by 25 bps in july, august, and september to a terminal rate of 4.85% vs 4.35% expected previously.\n\ncba \nthey now see the rba peak rate at 4.35%, most likely in august.\n\nboj\nthe boj continued with its monetary easing, which led to the yen declining after the rate decision. (image 2)\n\nhere is a summary of what was said:\nthe bank of japan will keep 10-yr japanese government bond (jgb) yields within a range of around plus or minus 0.5 percentage points and offer to purchase 10-year jgbs at a fixed rate of 0.5 percent every business day. to shape the yield curve according to its market operation guideline, the bank will continue large-scale jgb purchases and adjust the amount of purchases for each maturity.\n\njapan's economy has shown signs of improvement despite past high commodity prices and a slowdown in overseas economies. exports and industrial production have remained flat, supported by reduced supply-side constraints. corporate profits are high, leading to moderate increases in business fixed investment and improved employment and income conditions. private consumption has also increased moderately, although housing investment has been weak. financial conditions are generally accommodative, but some firms continue to face financial weakness.\n \nthe year-on-year consumer price index (cpi) inflation rate has slowed due to lower energy prices but remains around 3.5% due to cost increases in imports. inflation expectations have stabilized after rising. \n\nlooking ahead, japan's economy is expected to recover moderately in fiscal 2023, driven by pent-up demand and a strengthening income-spending cycle. however, growth is likely to gradually decelerate, and cpi inflation is expected to slow down temporarily before picking up again as the output gap improves and inflation expectations and wage growth rise.\n\nuk inflation\ninflation has been an aching pain in the backside for the boe for a while. headline inflation had been hovering around 10% for about 9 months or so. the last report saw a marked decline from 10.1% compared to the prior 8.7%. however, it did surprise economists who were expecting it to decline to 8.2%. this led to the pound strengthening and the expectation for the bank of england would continue raising rates.
