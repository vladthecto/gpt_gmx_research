This week seems like it will be a very quiet week in regard to major economic releases, or even sentiment.

We've already had Biden sign the debt deal over the weekend, two days before a default would occur, raising the debt ceiling to $31.4 trln and suspending the debt limit till 2025, whilst restricting government spending. (Image 1)

OPEC+ decided to more or less remain unchanged in their output, but the Saudis came in clutch with an extra 1 mln BDP cut expected to start in July. (Image 2)

ISM & Services PMIs
ISM services and S&P Services PMI are both closely watched economic indicators that provide insights into the performance of the services sector. However, they are published by different organizations and have some differences in methodology. Here's an overview of each:

ISM Services (Institute for Supply Management): The ISM Services Index, also known as the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, is published by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the economic activity in the non-manufacturing or services sector of the United States. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers from various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The survey covers areas such as new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories, and prices. The index is calculated by surveying the purchasing managers and assigning a diffusion index where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

According to Nieves from ISM, the historical relationship between the Services PMI and the overall economy suggests that the April reading corresponds to a 0.7-percent increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an annualized basis. This means that the services sector's growth, as indicated by the PMI, is expected to contribute positively to the overall economic growth.

S&P Services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): The S&P Services PMI is published by S&P. It measures the economic activity in the services sector globally, covering multiple countries including the United States. The PMI is based on monthly surveys of purchasing managers in various services industries, such as business services, healthcare, and hospitality. The surveys ask respondents about changes in key business variables such as new business orders, employment, output, and prices. The index is calculated using a diffusion index methodology, similar to the ISM Services, where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

S&P services is expected to remain unchanged at 55.1 in expansionary territory as is the ISM Services at 52.4 compared to the prior of 51.9

RBA Rate Decision
As the focus shifts from the US, we go to the opposite side of the world to Australia, where the RBA is expected to hold its Cash Rate at 3.85%, Tuesday at 12:30 AM ET.
This is the more difficult one to forecast with what the RBA might do at their upcoming policy meetings. In the past we had the RBA pause its rate on April 4th at 3.6%, which led to a delcine the the aussie dollar. 
Traders and economists at the the time held the notion that this could be where the RBA wil sit and wait to see how its hiking cycle effects the economy, and maybe continue to hold. However on May 2nd, the following meeting the RBA was expected to hold, but went for a 25 BPS hike instead. (Image 3) 

Why?
RBA had said in its Monetary Policy Statment that ""Inflation is still too high at 7%, and it will be some time before it returns to the target range"" and ""The board believes that additional tightening of monetary policy may be required"".

On May 14th NAB viewed RBA Cash Rate peak at least at 4.1%.
TDS also beleive the RBA has more hikes up their sleeves.

BoC
Now we sail back to North America to Canada. The BoC is expected to hold rates at 4.5%, with the bank getting closer to it's inflation goal, but we're not there yet. Currently at 4.4%, it was higher than economists forecasted by 0.1%. That might not do it for the BoC to raise rates again, but there are other factors in the mix, too.
