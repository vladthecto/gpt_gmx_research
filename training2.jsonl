This can be viewed as a positive sign for job seekers, as it suggests a relatively robust demand for labor.\n\nHires: The fact that the number of hires changed little at 6.1 million suggests that there was relatively stable hiring activity during the reported period. While not a significant increase, it still reflects ongoing recruitment efforts by employers.\n\nSeparations: The decrease in total separations to 5.7 million indicates a decline in the number of people leaving their jobs. This can be a positive sign as it suggests improved job stability and a potential decrease in involuntary job losses.\n\nQuits: The relatively stable number of quits at 3.8 million suggests that employees are not significantly changing their voluntary job termination behaviour. This could indicate a level of job satisfaction or confidence in finding alternative employment.\n\nLayoffs and Discharges: The decrease in layoffs and discharges to 1.6 million indicates a decline in involuntary job losses. This could be a positive sign, suggesting a more stable labor market and potentially improving economic conditions.\n\nHow did the markets react?\n- Despite the positive data the S&P 500 didn't follow the DXY. We hardly saw an initia reaction at all from the index compared to the dollar visually. (Figure 1)\n \n- Gold, however did see a bigger reaction, as the DXY and gold have a strong de-colloration i.e. whenever the dollar strengthens, gold weakens as you're able to buy more gold with a stronger dollar\n\nHow will this effect the Fed's decision making?\n- Although the Fed's main objective is to bring inflation back down to it's 2% target, jobs data, particularly the monthly data is still key.\n \n- The reason being, if more jobs are added to the economy, the more opportunity there is for consumers to increase their spending rather than save. That in turn means, the Fed may have more work to do.\n\n- Hence, you had US rate futures pricing in a 71% chance of a June rate hike, compared to the odds of 60% yesterday. (Figure 2)\n\n- However, the reasoning behind the S&P 500's almost non-existant reaction initially could be because the Fed in the last FOMC signalled openness to a pause and removed the phrasing that it would continue raising rate, and good data might be good data, albiet the stronger pricing in of a rate hike in June.\nSNB'S CHAIRMAN JORDAN: RISING INTEREST RATES POSITIVE FOR THE BANKING SYSTEM.\nSNB'S CHAIRMAN JORDAN: RISING INTEREST RATES WILL NOT DAMAGE FINANCIAL STABILITY IN SWITZERLAND.\nSNB'S CHAIRMAN JORDAN: I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE SPEED AND SIZE OF OUTFLOW OF DEPOSITS, ISSUE NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT.\nSNB'S CHAIRMAN JORDAN: THE LONGER INFLATION IS ABOVE 2%, IT BECOMES ENTRENCHED AND HARDER TO BRING IT DOWN.\nSNB'S CHAIRMAN JORDAN: I SEE INFLATION RISKS HIGHER THAN DEFLATION IN THE FUTURE, DUE TO DEGLOBALISATION.\nPARALLEL TALKS SHOULD BE HELD ON BROADENING THE BLACK SEA GRAIN DEAL TO INCLUDE MORE PORTS AND CARGOES - SOURCE.\nUKRAINE AND TURKEY HAVE ACCEPTED UN PROPOSALS AND RUSSIA YET TO RESPOND - SOURCE.\nBLACKROCK CEO FINK: INFLATION IS STILL TOO STRONG, I SEE MORE FED TIGHTENING.\nSNB'S CHAIRMAN JORDAN: I CURRENTLY DO NOT SEE THE NECESSITY FOR AN E-SWISS FRANC.\nBLACKROCK CEO FINK: A RECESSION IS LIKELY TO BE MODEST, IF WE EVEN HAVE ONE.\nBLACKROCK CEO FINK: THE FED IS NOT FINISHED, 2-4 MORE TIGHTENINGS, PROBABLY CLOSER TO TWO.\nBLACKROCK CEO FINK: I DON'T SEE EVIDENCE OF A REDUCTION IN INFLATION, OR EVIDENCE OF A HARD LANDING.\nFED'S COLLINS SPEAKS - WATCH LIVE invidious.fdn.fr\/9RwfIdgdXAY\nFED'S HARKER SPEAKS - REGISTER HERE omfif.org\/events\/federal-res\u2026\nFED'S COLLINS: THE FED IS INTENT ON REDUCING INFLATION, IT IS SIMPLY TOO HIGH.\n107 COUNTERPARTIES TAKE $2.255 TLN AT FED REVERSE REPO OPERATION.\nITALY'S PM MELONI: I AM GOING TO CREATE A \u20ac1 BILLION SOVEREIGN FUND.\nBIDEN: I HOPE CONGRESS WILL HAVE ACTED BY THE TIME I LAND IN COLORADO LATER TODAY.\nBIDEN: WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH DEBT CEILING, THINGS ARE GOING AS PLANNED.\nWATCH LIVE - FED'S JEFFERSON SPEAKS invidious.fdn.fr\/Lo5py7CP4j8\nFED'S JEFFERSON: A PAUSE AT A COMING MEETING DOESN'T MEAN RATES AT PEAK.\nFED'S JEFFERSON: A HIGHER RATES COULD EXACERBATE BANKING STRESS.\nFED'S JEFFERSON: INFLATION STILL TOO HIGH, BUT PROGRESS IS SLOWING RECENTLY.\nFED'S JEFFERSON: THE FED STAFF WORKING DILIGENTLY ON BASEL III PROPOSAL, EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT SOON.\nFED'S JEFFERSON: INFLATION REMAINS TOO HIGH AND PROGRESS BY SOME MEASURES HAS BEEN SLOWING.\nFED'S JEFFERSON: HOLDING THE US CENTRAL BANK'S POLICY RATE CONSTANT AT A COMING MEETING SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN TO MEAN RATES HAVE REACHED A PEAK FOR THIS TIGHTENING CYCLE.\nFED''S JEFFERSON: MONETARY POLICY WORKS WITH A LAG, AND A YEAR IS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO FEEL THE FULL EFFECT.\nFED'S JEFFERSON: SKIPPING A RATE INCREASE AT A COMING MEETING WOULD ALLOW FED OFFICIALS TO SEE MORE DATA BEFORE DECIDING ON EXTENT OF ADDITIONAL TIGHTENING THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED.\nFED'S JEFFERSON: BASE CASE OUTLOOK IS NOT FOR RECESSION, HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND LOWER EARNINGS COULD TEST THE ABILITY OF BUSINESSES TO SERVICE DEBT.\nFED'S JEFFERSON: IMPACT OF TIGHTER CREDIT ON THE ECONOMY REMAINS UNCERTAIN.\nUS SHORT-TERM INTEREST-RATE TRADERS TRIM BETS ON FURTHER FED POLICY TIGHTENING AFTER JEFFERSON'S REMARKS.\nFED'S JEFFERSON: CONDITIONS IN THE BANKING SECTOR HAVE STABILIZED, THE SYSTEM REMAINS RESILIENT.\nFED'S JEFFERSON FULL SPEECH federalreserve.gov\/newsevent\u2026\nFED JUNE RATE HIKE NOW SEEN AS A ONE-IN-THREE CHANCE, BASED ON FED FUNDS FUTURES; DOWN FROM 67% CHANCE SEEN BEFORE FED'S JEFFERSON'S REMARKS.\nFED'S HARKER: THIS ECONOMY KEEPS CHUGGING ALONG.\nFED'S HARKER: INFLATION IS STUBBORN, BUT LIKELY TO COME DOWN OVER TIME.\nFED'S HARKER: UNEMPLOYMENT IS GOING TO TICK UP TO AROUND 4.4%.\nFED'S HARKER: THE ECONOMY IS INCREDIBLY RESILIENT.\nFED'S HARKER: OUR MODAL FORECAST IS NOT FOR A RECESSION.\nRUSSIAN PLANS TO HALVE SUBSIDIES FOR OIL REFINERS MAY BE POSTPONED UNTIL SEPTEMBER - IFX CITES SOURCES.\nFED'S HARKER: I AM IN THE CAMP COMING INTO THIS MEETING THAT WE CAN SKIP A MEETING.

(Image 1)\n\nOPEC+ decided to more or less remain unchanged in their output, but the Saudis came in clutch with an extra 1 mln BDP cut expected to start in July. (Image 2)\n\nISM & Services PMIs\nISM services and S&P Services PMI are both closely watched economic indicators that provide insights into the performance of the services sector. However, they are published by different organizations and have some differences in methodology. Here's an overview of each:\n\nISM Services (Institute for Supply Management): The ISM Services Index, also known as the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, is published by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the economic activity in the non-manufacturing or services sector of the United States. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers from various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The survey covers areas such as new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories, and prices. The index is calculated by surveying the purchasing managers and assigning a diffusion index where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.\n\nAccording to Nieves from ISM, the historical relationship between the Services PMI and the overall economy suggests that the April reading corresponds to a 0.7-percent increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an annualized basis. This means that the services sector's growth, as indicated by the PMI, is expected to contribute positively to the overall economic growth.\n\nS&P Services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): The S&P Services PMI is published by S&P. It measures the economic activity in the services sector globally, covering multiple countries including the United States. The PMI is based on monthly surveys of purchasing managers in various services industries, such as business services, healthcare, and hospitality. The surveys ask respondents about changes in key business variables such as new business orders, employment, output, and prices. The index is calculated using a diffusion index methodology, similar to the ISM Services, where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.\n\nS&P services is expected to remain unchanged at 55.1 in expansionary territory as is the ISM Services at 52.4 compared to the prior of 51.9\n\nRBA Rate Decision\nAs the focus shifts from the US, we go to the opposite side of the world to Australia, where the RBA is expected to hold its Cash Rate at 3.85%, Tuesday at 12:30 AM ET.\nThis is the more difficult one to forecast with what the RBA might do at their upcoming policy meetings. In the past we had the RBA pause its rate on April 4th at 3.6%, which led to a delcine the the aussie dollar. \nTraders and economists at the the time held the notion that this could be where the RBA wil sit and wait to see how its hiking cycle effects the economy, and maybe continue to hold. However on May 2nd, the following meeting the RBA was expected to hold, but went for a 25 BPS hike instead. (Image 3) \n\nWhy?\nRBA had said in its Monetary Policy Statment that \"Inflation is still too high at 7%, and it will be some time before it returns to the target range\" and \"The board believes that additional tightening of monetary policy may be required\".\n\nOn May 14th NAB viewed RBA Cash Rate peak at least at 4.1%.\nTDS also beleive the RBA has more hikes up their sleeves.\n\nBoC\nNow we sail back to North America to Canada. The BoC is expected to hold rates at 4.5%, with the bank getting closer to it's inflation goal, but we're not there yet. Currently at 4.4%, it was higher than economists forecasted by 0.1%. That might not do it for the BoC to raise rates again, but there are other factors in the mix, too.\n\nTrade BoC with Tony Wednesday and Canadian Employment Friday LIVE HERE invidious.fdn.fr\/playlist?list=PL\u2026\nMORNING JUICE - US SESSION financialjuice.com\/News\/7450\u2026\nIRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE TO REOPEN DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS THIS WEEK - ISNA.\nIEA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BIROL: THERE'S AN IMBALANCE IN THE OIL MARKET IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR ALREADY, IT'LL WORSEN AFTER THE OPEC+ DECISION.\nIEA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BIROL: THE COUNTRIES THAT SUFFER MOST WITH HIGH OIL PRICES ARE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDIA, AND THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA.\nSECURED OVERNIGHT FINANCING RATE 5.07% JUNE 2ND VS 5.08% JUNE 1ST.\nRUSSIAN DEFENCE MINISTRY: TWO RUSSIAN STRATEGIC BOMBERS CARRIED OUT ROUTINE FLIGHT OVER BARENTS AND NORWEGIAN SEAS.\nCHINA'S TOP DIPLOMAT HAD PHONE CALL WITH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT'S ADVISOR.\nImportant: All Crypto Projects are a testing ground for what will be future features of Bitcoin.\n\nHowever as the next bull market gets closer, there will be LOTS of opportunity to trade the volatility of crypto using unusualactivity.live\nnope, just sharing another product we offer that provides volume and price alerts\nTURKEY\u2019S PRESIDENT ERDOGAN IS CONSIDERING APPOINTING ERKAN AS THE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR - TWO SOURCES.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: ITALY IS STRUGGLING TO SPEND EU RECOVERY PLAN CASH.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: TARGET 1.2%-1.4% GDP GROWTH FOR 2023.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINSTER GIORGETTI: ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT CURRENTLY PLANNING TO EXPAND DEFICIT.\nSAUDIS SEEK MORE OIL OUTPUT TRANSPARENCY FROM RUSSIA - ARABIYA.\nSAUDI ENERGY MINISTER: THE SAUDIS ARE FED UP WITH OPEC MEMBERS NOT MEETING OIL OUTPUT GOALS.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: I DON'T SEE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS FOR ITALIAN BANKS.\nMoving right now...\nWATCH LIVE - ECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE SPEAKS (VIDEO SAYS IT STARTS AT 10:00 AM ET)  multimedia.europarl.europa.e\u2026\nEFFECTIVE FED FUNDS RATE 5.08% JUNE 2, UNCHANGED.\nunusualactivity.live\n7 Day free trial: unusualactivity.live\nITALY'S ECONOMY MINISTER: I DO NOT PLAN A BANK WINDFALL TAX.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: PRICE PRESSURES REMAIN STRONG.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: UNDERLYING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES REMAIN HIGH.\nwhy? just alerts on spikes in volume and price.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THERE IS NO CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT UNDERLYING INFLATION HAS PEAKED.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: WAGE PRESSURES HAVE STRENGTHENED FURTHER.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: DECISIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE INFLATION OUTLOOK IN THE LIGHT OF THE INCOMING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DATA, THE DYNAMICS OF UNDERLYING INFLATION AND THE STRENGTH OF MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: OUR RATE HIKES ARE BEING TRANSMITTED FORCEFULLY TO FINANCING CONDITIONS.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THE FULL EFFECTS OF OUR MONETARY POLICY MEASURES ARE STARTING TO MATERIALISE.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THE\u00a0EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY TIGHTENING ON REAL ACTIVITY AND INFLATION CAN BE EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN IN THE COMING YEARS.\nDEUTSCHE BANK: WE HAVE CUT OUR EURO AREA 2024 GDP FORECAST TO 0.5% FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 1%.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: RATE HIKES ARE BEING TRANSMITTED FORCEFULLY TO CREDIT CONDITIONS.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: FINANCIAL STABILITY HAS PROVED ROBUST SO FAR.\nDoes this count as workplace bullying?\nEUROPEAN GAS FUTURES JUMP 20% ON EXPECTATIONS OF MORE DEMAND FROM ASIA.\nDEUTSCHE BANK: WE HAVE CUT THE 2024 GDP GROWTH FORECAST FOR THE UK TO 0.4% FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 0.8%.\nOIL LOADINGS FROM RUSSIA'S WESTERN PORTS HIT A 4-YEAR HIGH IN MAY - SOURCES.\nPOLL: CANADIAN HOME PRICES TO FALL MEDIAN 8.9% IN 2023 (VS 12% FALL IN THE MARCH POLL).\nPOLL: CANADIAN AVERAGE HOME PRICES TO RISE 2% AND 4% IN 2024 AND 2025, RESPECTIVELY (SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS POLL).\nWHAT'S MOVING THE S&P THIS MORNING?

(Image 1)\n\nOPEC+ decided to more or less remain unchanged in their output, but the Saudis came in clutch with an extra 1 mln BDP cut expected to start in July. (Image 2)\n\nISM & Services PMIs\nISM services and S&P Services PMI are both closely watched economic indicators that provide insights into the performance of the services sector. However, they are published by different organizations and have some differences in methodology. Here's an overview of each:\n\nISM Services (Institute for Supply Management): The ISM Services Index, also known as the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, is published by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the economic activity in the non-manufacturing or services sector of the United States. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers from various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The survey covers areas such as new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories, and prices. The index is calculated by surveying the purchasing managers and assigning a diffusion index where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.\n\nAccording to Nieves from ISM, the historical relationship between the Services PMI and the overall economy suggests that the April reading corresponds to a 0.7-percent increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an annualized basis. This means that the services sector's growth, as indicated by the PMI, is expected to contribute positively to the overall economic growth.\n\nS&P Services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): The S&P Services PMI is published by S&P. It measures the economic activity in the services sector globally, covering multiple countries including the United States. The PMI is based on monthly surveys of purchasing managers in various services industries, such as business services, healthcare, and hospitality. The surveys ask respondents about changes in key business variables such as new business orders, employment, output, and prices. The index is calculated using a diffusion index methodology, similar to the ISM Services, where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.\n\nS&P services is expected to remain unchanged at 55.1 in expansionary territory as is the ISM Services at 52.4 compared to the prior of 51.9\n\nRBA Rate Decision\nAs the focus shifts from the US, we go to the opposite side of the world to Australia, where the RBA is expected to hold its Cash Rate at 3.85%, Tuesday at 12:30 AM ET.\nThis is the more difficult one to forecast with what the RBA might do at their upcoming policy meetings. In the past we had the RBA pause its rate on April 4th at 3.6%, which led to a delcine the the aussie dollar. \nTraders and economists at the the time held the notion that this could be where the RBA wil sit and wait to see how its hiking cycle effects the economy, and maybe continue to hold. However on May 2nd, the following meeting the RBA was expected to hold, but went for a 25 BPS hike instead. (Image 3) \n\nWhy?\nRBA had said in its Monetary Policy Statment that \"Inflation is still too high at 7%, and it will be some time before it returns to the target range\" and \"The board believes that additional tightening of monetary policy may be required\".\n\nOn May 14th NAB viewed RBA Cash Rate peak at least at 4.1%.\nTDS also beleive the RBA has more hikes up their sleeves.\n\nBoC\nNow we sail back to North America to Canada. The BoC is expected to hold rates at 4.5%, with the bank getting closer to it's inflation goal, but we're not there yet. Currently at 4.4%, it was higher than economists forecasted by 0.1%. That might not do it for the BoC to raise rates again, but there are other factors in the mix, too.\n\nTrade BoC with Tony Wednesday and Canadian Employment Friday LIVE HERE invidious.fdn.fr\/playlist?list=PL\u2026\nMORNING JUICE - US SESSION financialjuice.com\/News\/7450\u2026\nIRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE TO REOPEN DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS THIS WEEK - ISNA.\nIEA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BIROL: THERE'S AN IMBALANCE IN THE OIL MARKET IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR ALREADY, IT'LL WORSEN AFTER THE OPEC+ DECISION.\nIEA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BIROL: THE COUNTRIES THAT SUFFER MOST WITH HIGH OIL PRICES ARE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDIA, AND THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA.\nSECURED OVERNIGHT FINANCING RATE 5.07% JUNE 2ND VS 5.08% JUNE 1ST.\nRUSSIAN DEFENCE MINISTRY: TWO RUSSIAN STRATEGIC BOMBERS CARRIED OUT ROUTINE FLIGHT OVER BARENTS AND NORWEGIAN SEAS.\nCHINA'S TOP DIPLOMAT HAD PHONE CALL WITH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT'S ADVISOR.\nImportant: All Crypto Projects are a testing ground for what will be future features of Bitcoin.\n\nHowever as the next bull market gets closer, there will be LOTS of opportunity to trade the volatility of crypto using unusualactivity.live\nnope, just sharing another product we offer that provides volume and price alerts\nTURKEY\u2019S PRESIDENT ERDOGAN IS CONSIDERING APPOINTING ERKAN AS THE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR - TWO SOURCES.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: ITALY IS STRUGGLING TO SPEND EU RECOVERY PLAN CASH.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: TARGET 1.2%-1.4% GDP GROWTH FOR 2023.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINSTER GIORGETTI: ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT CURRENTLY PLANNING TO EXPAND DEFICIT.\nSAUDIS SEEK MORE OIL OUTPUT TRANSPARENCY FROM RUSSIA - ARABIYA.\nSAUDI ENERGY MINISTER: THE SAUDIS ARE FED UP WITH OPEC MEMBERS NOT MEETING OIL OUTPUT GOALS.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: I DON'T SEE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS FOR ITALIAN BANKS.\nMoving right now...\nWATCH LIVE - ECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE SPEAKS (VIDEO SAYS IT STARTS AT 10:00 AM ET)  multimedia.europarl.europa.e\u2026\nunusualactivity.live\nEFFECTIVE FED FUNDS RATE 5.08% JUNE 2, UNCHANGED.\n7 Day free trial: unusualactivity.live\nITALY'S ECONOMY MINISTER: I DO NOT PLAN A BANK WINDFALL TAX.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: PRICE PRESSURES REMAIN STRONG.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: UNDERLYING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES REMAIN HIGH.\nwhy? just alerts on spikes in volume and price.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THERE IS NO CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT UNDERLYING INFLATION HAS PEAKED.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: WAGE PRESSURES HAVE STRENGTHENED FURTHER.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: DECISIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE INFLATION OUTLOOK IN THE LIGHT OF THE INCOMING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DATA, THE DYNAMICS OF UNDERLYING INFLATION AND THE STRENGTH OF MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: OUR RATE HIKES ARE BEING TRANSMITTED FORCEFULLY TO FINANCING CONDITIONS.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THE FULL EFFECTS OF OUR MONETARY POLICY MEASURES ARE STARTING TO MATERIALISE.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THE\u00a0EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY TIGHTENING ON REAL ACTIVITY AND INFLATION CAN BE EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN IN THE COMING YEARS.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: RATE HIKES ARE BEING TRANSMITTED FORCEFULLY TO CREDIT CONDITIONS.\nDEUTSCHE BANK: WE HAVE CUT OUR EURO AREA 2024 GDP FORECAST TO 0.5% FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 1%.\nDoes this count as workplace bullying?\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: FINANCIAL STABILITY HAS PROVED ROBUST SO FAR.\nEUROPEAN GAS FUTURES JUMP 20% ON EXPECTATIONS OF MORE DEMAND FROM ASIA.\nDEUTSCHE BANK: WE HAVE CUT THE 2024 GDP GROWTH FORECAST FOR THE UK TO 0.4% FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 0.8%.\nOIL LOADINGS FROM RUSSIA'S WESTERN PORTS HIT A 4-YEAR HIGH IN MAY - SOURCES.\nPOLL: CANADIAN HOME PRICES TO FALL MEDIAN 8.9% IN 2023 (VS 12% FALL IN THE MARCH POLL).\nPOLL: CANADIAN AVERAGE HOME PRICES TO RISE 2% AND 4% IN 2024 AND 2025, RESPECTIVELY (SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS POLL).\nWHAT'S MOVING THE S&P THIS MORNING?

(Image 2)\n\nISM & Services PMIs\nISM services and S&P Services PMI are both closely watched economic indicators that provide insights into the performance of the services sector. However, they are published by different organizations and have some differences in methodology. Here's an overview of each:\n\nISM Services (Institute for Supply Management): The ISM Services Index, also known as the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, is published by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the economic activity in the non-manufacturing or services sector of the United States. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers from various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The survey covers areas such as new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories, and prices. The index is calculated by surveying the purchasing managers and assigning a diffusion index where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.\n\nAccording to Nieves from ISM, the historical relationship between the Services PMI and the overall economy suggests that the April reading corresponds to a 0.7-percent increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an annualized basis. This means that the services sector's growth, as indicated by the PMI, is expected to contribute positively to the overall economic growth.\n\nS&P Services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): The S&P Services PMI is published by S&P. It measures the economic activity in the services sector globally, covering multiple countries including the United States. The PMI is based on monthly surveys of purchasing managers in various services industries, such as business services, healthcare, and hospitality. The surveys ask respondents about changes in key business variables such as new business orders, employment, output, and prices. The index is calculated using a diffusion index methodology, similar to the ISM Services, where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.\n\nS&P services is expected to remain unchanged at 55.1 in expansionary territory as is the ISM Services at 52.4 compared to the prior of 51.9\n\nRBA Rate Decision\nAs the focus shifts from the US, we go to the opposite side of the world to Australia, where the RBA is expected to hold its Cash Rate at 3.85%, Tuesday at 12:30 AM ET.\nThis is the more difficult one to forecast with what the RBA might do at their upcoming policy meetings. In the past we had the RBA pause its rate on April 4th at 3.6%, which led to a delcine the the aussie dollar. \nTraders and economists at the the time held the notion that this could be where the RBA wil sit and wait to see how its hiking cycle effects the economy, and maybe continue to hold. However on May 2nd, the following meeting the RBA was expected to hold, but went for a 25 BPS hike instead. (Image 3) \n\nWhy?\nRBA had said in its Monetary Policy Statment that \"Inflation is still too high at 7%, and it will be some time before it returns to the target range\" and \"The board believes that additional tightening of monetary policy may be required\".\n\nOn May 14th NAB viewed RBA Cash Rate peak at least at 4.1%.\nTDS also beleive the RBA has more hikes up their sleeves.\n\nBoC\nNow we sail back to North America to Canada. The BoC is expected to hold rates at 4.5%, with the bank getting closer to it's inflation goal, but we're not there yet. Currently at 4.4%, it was higher than economists forecasted by 0.1%. That might not do it for the BoC to raise rates again, but there are other factors in the mix, too.\n\nTrade BoC with Tony Wednesday and Canadian Employment Friday LIVE HERE invidious.fdn.fr\/playlist?list=PL\u2026\nMORNING JUICE - US SESSION financialjuice.com\/News\/7450\u2026\nIRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE TO REOPEN DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS THIS WEEK - ISNA.\nIEA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BIROL: THERE'S AN IMBALANCE IN THE OIL MARKET IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR ALREADY, IT'LL WORSEN AFTER THE OPEC+ DECISION.\nIEA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BIROL: THE COUNTRIES THAT SUFFER MOST WITH HIGH OIL PRICES ARE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDIA, AND THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA.\nSECURED OVERNIGHT FINANCING RATE 5.07% JUNE 2ND VS 5.08% JUNE 1ST.\nRUSSIAN DEFENCE MINISTRY: TWO RUSSIAN STRATEGIC BOMBERS CARRIED OUT ROUTINE FLIGHT OVER BARENTS AND NORWEGIAN SEAS.\nCHINA'S TOP DIPLOMAT HAD PHONE CALL WITH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT'S ADVISOR.\nImportant: All Crypto Projects are a testing ground for what will be future features of Bitcoin.\n\nHowever as the next bull market gets closer, there will be LOTS of opportunity to trade the volatility of crypto using unusualactivity.live\nnope, just sharing another product we offer that provides volume and price alerts\nTURKEY\u2019S PRESIDENT ERDOGAN IS CONSIDERING APPOINTING ERKAN AS THE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR - TWO SOURCES.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: ITALY IS STRUGGLING TO SPEND EU RECOVERY PLAN CASH.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: TARGET 1.2%-1.4% GDP GROWTH FOR 2023.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINSTER GIORGETTI: ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT CURRENTLY PLANNING TO EXPAND DEFICIT.\nSAUDIS SEEK MORE OIL OUTPUT TRANSPARENCY FROM RUSSIA - ARABIYA.\nSAUDI ENERGY MINISTER: THE SAUDIS ARE FED UP WITH OPEC MEMBERS NOT MEETING OIL OUTPUT GOALS.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: I DON'T SEE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS FOR ITALIAN BANKS.\nMoving right now...\nWATCH LIVE - ECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE SPEAKS (VIDEO SAYS IT STARTS AT 10:00 AM ET)  multimedia.europarl.europa.e\u2026\nEFFECTIVE FED FUNDS RATE 5.08% JUNE 2, UNCHANGED.\nunusualactivity.live\n7 Day free trial: unusualactivity.live\nITALY'S ECONOMY MINISTER: I DO NOT PLAN A BANK WINDFALL TAX.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: PRICE PRESSURES REMAIN STRONG.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: UNDERLYING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES REMAIN HIGH.\nwhy? just alerts on spikes in volume and price.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THERE IS NO CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT UNDERLYING INFLATION HAS PEAKED.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: WAGE PRESSURES HAVE STRENGTHENED FURTHER.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: DECISIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE INFLATION OUTLOOK IN THE LIGHT OF THE INCOMING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DATA, THE DYNAMICS OF UNDERLYING INFLATION AND THE STRENGTH OF MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: OUR RATE HIKES ARE BEING TRANSMITTED FORCEFULLY TO FINANCING CONDITIONS.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THE FULL EFFECTS OF OUR MONETARY POLICY MEASURES ARE STARTING TO MATERIALISE.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THE\u00a0EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY TIGHTENING ON REAL ACTIVITY AND INFLATION CAN BE EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN IN THE COMING YEARS.\nDEUTSCHE BANK: WE HAVE CUT OUR EURO AREA 2024 GDP FORECAST TO 0.5% FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 1%.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: RATE HIKES ARE BEING TRANSMITTED FORCEFULLY TO CREDIT CONDITIONS.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: FINANCIAL STABILITY HAS PROVED ROBUST SO FAR.\nDoes this count as workplace bullying?\nEUROPEAN GAS FUTURES JUMP 20% ON EXPECTATIONS OF MORE DEMAND FROM ASIA.\nDEUTSCHE BANK: WE HAVE CUT THE 2024 GDP GROWTH FORECAST FOR THE UK TO 0.4% FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 0.8%.\nOIL LOADINGS FROM RUSSIA'S WESTERN PORTS HIT A 4-YEAR HIGH IN MAY - SOURCES.\nPOLL: CANADIAN HOME PRICES TO FALL MEDIAN 8.9% IN 2023 (VS 12% FALL IN THE MARCH POLL).\nPOLL: CANADIAN AVERAGE HOME PRICES TO RISE 2% AND 4% IN 2024 AND 2025, RESPECTIVELY (SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS POLL).\nWHAT'S MOVING THE S&P THIS MORNING?

(Image 1)\n\nOPEC+ decided to more or less remain unchanged in their output, but the Saudis came in clutch with an extra 1 mln BDP cut expected to start in July. (Image 2)\n\nISM & Services PMIs\nISM services and S&P Services PMI are both closely watched economic indicators that provide insights into the performance of the services sector. However, they are published by different organizations and have some differences in methodology. Here's an overview of each:\n\nISM Services (Institute for Supply Management): The ISM Services Index, also known as the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, is published by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the economic activity in the non-manufacturing or services sector of the United States. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers from various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The survey covers areas such as new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories, and prices. The index is calculated by surveying the purchasing managers and assigning a diffusion index where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.\n\nAccording to Nieves from ISM, the historical relationship between the Services PMI and the overall economy suggests that the April reading corresponds to a 0.7-percent increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an annualized basis. This means that the services sector's growth, as indicated by the PMI, is expected to contribute positively to the overall economic growth.\n\nS&P Services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): The S&P Services PMI is published by S&P. It measures the economic activity in the services sector globally, covering multiple countries including the United States. The PMI is based on monthly surveys of purchasing managers in various services industries, such as business services, healthcare, and hospitality. The surveys ask respondents about changes in key business variables such as new business orders, employment, output, and prices. The index is calculated using a diffusion index methodology, similar to the ISM Services, where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.\n\nS&P services is expected to remain unchanged at 55.1 in expansionary territory as is the ISM Services at 52.4 compared to the prior of 51.9\n\nRBA Rate Decision\nAs the focus shifts from the US, we go to the opposite side of the world to Australia, where the RBA is expected to hold its Cash Rate at 3.85%, Tuesday at 12:30 AM ET.\nThis is the more difficult one to forecast with what the RBA might do at their upcoming policy meetings. In the past we had the RBA pause its rate on April 4th at 3.6%, which led to a delcine the the aussie dollar. \nTraders and economists at the the time held the notion that this could be where the RBA wil sit and wait to see how its hiking cycle effects the economy, and maybe continue to hold. However on May 2nd, the following meeting the RBA was expected to hold, but went for a 25 BPS hike instead. (Image 3) \n\nWhy?\nRBA had said in its Monetary Policy Statment that \"Inflation is still too high at 7%, and it will be some time before it returns to the target range\" and \"The board believes that additional tightening of monetary policy may be required\".\n\nOn May 14th NAB viewed RBA Cash Rate peak at least at 4.1%.\nTDS also beleive the RBA has more hikes up their sleeves.\n\nBoC\nNow we sail back to North America to Canada. The BoC is expected to hold rates at 4.5%, with the bank getting closer to it's inflation goal, but we're not there yet. Currently at 4.4%, it was higher than economists forecasted by 0.1%. That might not do it for the BoC to raise rates again, but there are other factors in the mix, too.\n\nTrade BoC with Tony Wednesday and Canadian Employment Friday LIVE HERE invidious.fdn.fr\/playlist?list=PL\u2026\nMORNING JUICE - US SESSION financialjuice.com\/News\/7450\u2026\nIRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE TO REOPEN DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS THIS WEEK - ISNA.\nIEA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BIROL: THERE'S AN IMBALANCE IN THE OIL MARKET IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR ALREADY, IT'LL WORSEN AFTER THE OPEC+ DECISION.\nIEA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BIROL: THE COUNTRIES THAT SUFFER MOST WITH HIGH OIL PRICES ARE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDIA, AND THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA.\nSECURED OVERNIGHT FINANCING RATE 5.07% JUNE 2ND VS 5.08% JUNE 1ST.\nRUSSIAN DEFENCE MINISTRY: TWO RUSSIAN STRATEGIC BOMBERS CARRIED OUT ROUTINE FLIGHT OVER BARENTS AND NORWEGIAN SEAS.\nCHINA'S TOP DIPLOMAT HAD PHONE CALL WITH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT'S ADVISOR.\nImportant: All Crypto Projects are a testing ground for what will be future features of Bitcoin.\n\nHowever as the next bull market gets closer, there will be LOTS of opportunity to trade the volatility of crypto using unusualactivity.live\nnope, just sharing another product we offer that provides volume and price alerts\nTURKEY\u2019S PRESIDENT ERDOGAN IS CONSIDERING APPOINTING ERKAN AS THE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR - TWO SOURCES.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: ITALY IS STRUGGLING TO SPEND EU RECOVERY PLAN CASH.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: TARGET 1.2%-1.4% GDP GROWTH FOR 2023.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINSTER GIORGETTI: ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT CURRENTLY PLANNING TO EXPAND DEFICIT.\nSAUDIS SEEK MORE OIL OUTPUT TRANSPARENCY FROM RUSSIA - ARABIYA.\nSAUDI ENERGY MINISTER: THE SAUDIS ARE FED UP WITH OPEC MEMBERS NOT MEETING OIL OUTPUT GOALS.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: I DON'T SEE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS FOR ITALIAN BANKS.\nMoving right now...\nWATCH LIVE - ECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE SPEAKS (VIDEO SAYS IT STARTS AT 10:00 AM ET)  multimedia.europarl.europa.e\u2026\nunusualactivity.live\nEFFECTIVE FED FUNDS RATE 5.08% JUNE 2, UNCHANGED.\n7 Day free trial: unusualactivity.live\nITALY'S ECONOMY MINISTER: I DO NOT PLAN A BANK WINDFALL TAX.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: PRICE PRESSURES REMAIN STRONG.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: UNDERLYING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES REMAIN HIGH.\nwhy? just alerts on spikes in volume and price.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THERE IS NO CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT UNDERLYING INFLATION HAS PEAKED.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: WAGE PRESSURES HAVE STRENGTHENED FURTHER.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: DECISIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE INFLATION OUTLOOK IN THE LIGHT OF THE INCOMING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DATA, THE DYNAMICS OF UNDERLYING INFLATION AND THE STRENGTH OF MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: OUR RATE HIKES ARE BEING TRANSMITTED FORCEFULLY TO FINANCING CONDITIONS.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THE FULL EFFECTS OF OUR MONETARY POLICY MEASURES ARE STARTING TO MATERIALISE.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THE\u00a0EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY TIGHTENING ON REAL ACTIVITY AND INFLATION CAN BE EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN IN THE COMING YEARS.\nDEUTSCHE BANK: WE HAVE CUT OUR EURO AREA 2024 GDP FORECAST TO 0.5% FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 1%.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: RATE HIKES ARE BEING TRANSMITTED FORCEFULLY TO CREDIT CONDITIONS.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: FINANCIAL STABILITY HAS PROVED ROBUST SO FAR.\nDoes this count as workplace bullying?\nEUROPEAN GAS FUTURES JUMP 20% ON EXPECTATIONS OF MORE DEMAND FROM ASIA.\nDEUTSCHE BANK: WE HAVE CUT THE 2024 GDP GROWTH FORECAST FOR THE UK TO 0.4% FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 0.8%.\nOIL LOADINGS FROM RUSSIA'S WESTERN PORTS HIT A 4-YEAR HIGH IN MAY - SOURCES.\nPOLL: CANADIAN HOME PRICES TO FALL MEDIAN 8.9% IN 2023 (VS 12% FALL IN THE MARCH POLL).\nPOLL: CANADIAN AVERAGE HOME PRICES TO RISE 2% AND 4% IN 2024 AND 2025, RESPECTIVELY (SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS POLL).\nWHAT'S MOVING THE S&P THIS MORNING?

(Image 2)\n\nISM & Services PMIs\nISM services and S&P Services PMI are both closely watched economic indicators that provide insights into the performance of the services sector. However, they are published by different organizations and have some differences in methodology. Here's an overview of each:\n\nISM Services (Institute for Supply Management): The ISM Services Index, also known as the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, is published by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the economic activity in the non-manufacturing or services sector of the United States. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers from various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The survey covers areas such as new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories, and prices. The index is calculated by surveying the purchasing managers and assigning a diffusion index where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.\n\nAccording to Nieves from ISM, the historical relationship between the Services PMI and the overall economy suggests that the April reading corresponds to a 0.7-percent increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an annualized basis. This means that the services sector's growth, as indicated by the PMI, is expected to contribute positively to the overall economic growth.\n\nS&P Services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): The S&P Services PMI is published by S&P. It measures the economic activity in the services sector globally, covering multiple countries including the United States. The PMI is based on monthly surveys of purchasing managers in various services industries, such as business services, healthcare, and hospitality. The surveys ask respondents about changes in key business variables such as new business orders, employment, output, and prices. The index is calculated using a diffusion index methodology, similar to the ISM Services, where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.\n\nS&P services is expected to remain unchanged at 55.1 in expansionary territory as is the ISM Services at 52.4 compared to the prior of 51.9\n\nRBA Rate Decision\nAs the focus shifts from the US, we go to the opposite side of the world to Australia, where the RBA is expected to hold its Cash Rate at 3.85%, Tuesday at 12:30 AM ET.\nThis is the more difficult one to forecast with what the RBA might do at their upcoming policy meetings. In the past we had the RBA pause its rate on April 4th at 3.6%, which led to a delcine the the aussie dollar. \nTraders and economists at the the time held the notion that this could be where the RBA wil sit and wait to see how its hiking cycle effects the economy, and maybe continue to hold. However on May 2nd, the following meeting the RBA was expected to hold, but went for a 25 BPS hike instead. (Image 3) \n\nWhy?\nRBA had said in its Monetary Policy Statment that \"Inflation is still too high at 7%, and it will be some time before it returns to the target range\" and \"The board believes that additional tightening of monetary policy may be required\".\n\nOn May 14th NAB viewed RBA Cash Rate peak at least at 4.1%.\nTDS also beleive the RBA has more hikes up their sleeves.\n\nBoC\nNow we sail back to North America to Canada. The BoC is expected to hold rates at 4.5%, with the bank getting closer to it's inflation goal, but we're not there yet. Currently at 4.4%, it was higher than economists forecasted by 0.1%. That might not do it for the BoC to raise rates again, but there are other factors in the mix, too.\n\nTrade BoC with Tony Wednesday and Canadian Employment Friday LIVE HERE invidious.fdn.fr\/playlist?list=PL\u2026\nMORNING JUICE - US SESSION financialjuice.com\/News\/7450\u2026\nIRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE TO REOPEN DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS THIS WEEK - ISNA.\nIEA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BIROL: THERE'S AN IMBALANCE IN THE OIL MARKET IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR ALREADY, IT'LL WORSEN AFTER THE OPEC+ DECISION.\nIEA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BIROL: THE COUNTRIES THAT SUFFER MOST WITH HIGH OIL PRICES ARE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDIA, AND THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA.\nSECURED OVERNIGHT FINANCING RATE 5.07% JUNE 2ND VS 5.08% JUNE 1ST.\nRUSSIAN DEFENCE MINISTRY: TWO RUSSIAN STRATEGIC BOMBERS CARRIED OUT ROUTINE FLIGHT OVER BARENTS AND NORWEGIAN SEAS.\nCHINA'S TOP DIPLOMAT HAD PHONE CALL WITH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT'S ADVISOR.\nImportant: All Crypto Projects are a testing ground for what will be future features of Bitcoin.\n\nHowever as the next bull market gets closer, there will be LOTS of opportunity to trade the volatility of crypto using unusualactivity.live\nnope, just sharing another product we offer that provides volume and price alerts\nTURKEY\u2019S PRESIDENT ERDOGAN IS CONSIDERING APPOINTING ERKAN AS THE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR - TWO SOURCES.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: ITALY IS STRUGGLING TO SPEND EU RECOVERY PLAN CASH.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: TARGET 1.2%-1.4% GDP GROWTH FOR 2023.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINSTER GIORGETTI: ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT CURRENTLY PLANNING TO EXPAND DEFICIT.\nSAUDIS SEEK MORE OIL OUTPUT TRANSPARENCY FROM RUSSIA - ARABIYA.\nSAUDI ENERGY MINISTER: THE SAUDIS ARE FED UP WITH OPEC MEMBERS NOT MEETING OIL OUTPUT GOALS.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: I DON'T SEE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS FOR ITALIAN BANKS.\nMoving right now...\nWATCH LIVE - ECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE SPEAKS (VIDEO SAYS IT STARTS AT 10:00 AM ET)  multimedia.europarl.europa.e\u2026\nunusualactivity.live\nEFFECTIVE FED FUNDS RATE 5.08% JUNE 2, UNCHANGED.\n7 Day free trial: unusualactivity.live\nITALY'S ECONOMY MINISTER: I DO NOT PLAN A BANK WINDFALL TAX.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: PRICE PRESSURES REMAIN STRONG.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: UNDERLYING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES REMAIN HIGH.\nwhy? just alerts on spikes in volume and price.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THERE IS NO CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT UNDERLYING INFLATION HAS PEAKED.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: WAGE PRESSURES HAVE STRENGTHENED FURTHER.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: DECISIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE INFLATION OUTLOOK IN THE LIGHT OF THE INCOMING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DATA, THE DYNAMICS OF UNDERLYING INFLATION AND THE STRENGTH OF MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: OUR RATE HIKES ARE BEING TRANSMITTED FORCEFULLY TO FINANCING CONDITIONS.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THE FULL EFFECTS OF OUR MONETARY POLICY MEASURES ARE STARTING TO MATERIALISE.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THE\u00a0EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY TIGHTENING ON REAL ACTIVITY AND INFLATION CAN BE EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN IN THE COMING YEARS.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: RATE HIKES ARE BEING TRANSMITTED FORCEFULLY TO CREDIT CONDITIONS.\nDEUTSCHE BANK: WE HAVE CUT OUR EURO AREA 2024 GDP FORECAST TO 0.5% FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 1%.\nDoes this count as workplace bullying?\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: FINANCIAL STABILITY HAS PROVED ROBUST SO FAR.\nEUROPEAN GAS FUTURES JUMP 20% ON EXPECTATIONS OF MORE DEMAND FROM ASIA.\nDEUTSCHE BANK: WE HAVE CUT THE 2024 GDP GROWTH FORECAST FOR THE UK TO 0.4% FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 0.8%.\nOIL LOADINGS FROM RUSSIA'S WESTERN PORTS HIT A 4-YEAR HIGH IN MAY - SOURCES.\nPOLL: CANADIAN HOME PRICES TO FALL MEDIAN 8.9% IN 2023 (VS 12% FALL IN THE MARCH POLL).\nPOLL: CANADIAN AVERAGE HOME PRICES TO RISE 2% AND 4% IN 2024 AND 2025, RESPECTIVELY (SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS POLL).\nWHAT'S MOVING THE S&P THIS MORNING?

(Image 1)\n\nOPEC+ decided to more or less remain unchanged in their output, but the Saudis came in clutch with an extra 1 mln BDP cut expected to start in July. (Image 2)\n\nISM & Services PMIs\nISM services and S&P Services PMI are both closely watched economic indicators that provide insights into the performance of the services sector. However, they are published by different organizations and have some differences in methodology. Here's an overview of each:\n\nISM Services (Institute for Supply Management): The ISM Services Index, also known as the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, is published by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the economic activity in the non-manufacturing or services sector of the United States. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers from various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The survey covers areas such as new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories, and prices. The index is calculated by surveying the purchasing managers and assigning a diffusion index where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.\n\nAccording to Nieves from ISM, the historical relationship between the Services PMI and the overall economy suggests that the April reading corresponds to a 0.7-percent increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an annualized basis. This means that the services sector's growth, as indicated by the PMI, is expected to contribute positively to the overall economic growth.\n\nS&P Services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): The S&P Services PMI is published by S&P. It measures the economic activity in the services sector globally, covering multiple countries including the United States. The PMI is based on monthly surveys of purchasing managers in various services industries, such as business services, healthcare, and hospitality. The surveys ask respondents about changes in key business variables such as new business orders, employment, output, and prices. The index is calculated using a diffusion index methodology, similar to the ISM Services, where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.\n\nS&P services is expected to remain unchanged at 55.1 in expansionary territory as is the ISM Services at 52.4 compared to the prior of 51.9\n\nRBA Rate Decision\nAs the focus shifts from the US, we go to the opposite side of the world to Australia, where the RBA is expected to hold its Cash Rate at 3.85%, Tuesday at 12:30 AM ET.\nThis is the more difficult one to forecast with what the RBA might do at their upcoming policy meetings. In the past we had the RBA pause its rate on April 4th at 3.6%, which led to a delcine the the aussie dollar. \nTraders and economists at the the time held the notion that this could be where the RBA wil sit and wait to see how its hiking cycle effects the economy, and maybe continue to hold. However on May 2nd, the following meeting the RBA was expected to hold, but went for a 25 BPS hike instead. (Image 3) \n\nWhy?\nRBA had said in its Monetary Policy Statment that \"Inflation is still too high at 7%, and it will be some time before it returns to the target range\" and \"The board believes that additional tightening of monetary policy may be required\".\n\nOn May 14th NAB viewed RBA Cash Rate peak at least at 4.1%.\nTDS also beleive the RBA has more hikes up their sleeves.\n\nBoC\nNow we sail back to North America to Canada. The BoC is expected to hold rates at 4.5%, with the bank getting closer to it's inflation goal, but we're not there yet. Currently at 4.4%, it was higher than economists forecasted by 0.1%. That might not do it for the BoC to raise rates again, but there are other factors in the mix, too.\n\nTrade BoC with Tony Wednesday and Canadian Employment Friday LIVE HERE invidious.fdn.fr\/playlist?list=PL\u2026\nMORNING JUICE - US SESSION financialjuice.com\/News\/7450\u2026\nIRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE TO REOPEN DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS THIS WEEK - ISNA.\nIEA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BIROL: THERE'S AN IMBALANCE IN THE OIL MARKET IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR ALREADY, IT'LL WORSEN AFTER THE OPEC+ DECISION.\nIEA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BIROL: THE COUNTRIES THAT SUFFER MOST WITH HIGH OIL PRICES ARE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDIA, AND THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA.\nSECURED OVERNIGHT FINANCING RATE 5.07% JUNE 2ND VS 5.08% JUNE 1ST.\nRUSSIAN DEFENCE MINISTRY: TWO RUSSIAN STRATEGIC BOMBERS CARRIED OUT ROUTINE FLIGHT OVER BARENTS AND NORWEGIAN SEAS.\nCHINA'S TOP DIPLOMAT HAD PHONE CALL WITH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT'S ADVISOR.\nImportant: All Crypto Projects are a testing ground for what will be future features of Bitcoin.\n\nHowever as the next bull market gets closer, there will be LOTS of opportunity to trade the volatility of crypto using unusualactivity.live\nnope, just sharing another product we offer that provides volume and price alerts\nTURKEY\u2019S PRESIDENT ERDOGAN IS CONSIDERING APPOINTING ERKAN AS THE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR - TWO SOURCES.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: ITALY IS STRUGGLING TO SPEND EU RECOVERY PLAN CASH.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: TARGET 1.2%-1.4% GDP GROWTH FOR 2023.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINSTER GIORGETTI: ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT CURRENTLY PLANNING TO EXPAND DEFICIT.\nSAUDIS SEEK MORE OIL OUTPUT TRANSPARENCY FROM RUSSIA - ARABIYA.\nSAUDI ENERGY MINISTER: THE SAUDIS ARE FED UP WITH OPEC MEMBERS NOT MEETING OIL OUTPUT GOALS.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: I DON'T SEE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS FOR ITALIAN BANKS.\nMoving right now...\nWATCH LIVE - ECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE SPEAKS (VIDEO SAYS IT STARTS AT 10:00 AM ET)  multimedia.europarl.europa.e\u2026\nunusualactivity.live\nEFFECTIVE FED FUNDS RATE 5.08% JUNE 2, UNCHANGED.\n7 Day free trial: unusualactivity.live\nITALY'S ECONOMY MINISTER: I DO NOT PLAN A BANK WINDFALL TAX.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: PRICE PRESSURES REMAIN STRONG.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: UNDERLYING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES REMAIN HIGH.\nwhy? just alerts on spikes in volume and price.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THERE IS NO CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT UNDERLYING INFLATION HAS PEAKED.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: WAGE PRESSURES HAVE STRENGTHENED FURTHER.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: DECISIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE INFLATION OUTLOOK IN THE LIGHT OF THE INCOMING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DATA, THE DYNAMICS OF UNDERLYING INFLATION AND THE STRENGTH OF MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: OUR RATE HIKES ARE BEING TRANSMITTED FORCEFULLY TO FINANCING CONDITIONS.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THE FULL EFFECTS OF OUR MONETARY POLICY MEASURES ARE STARTING TO MATERIALISE.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THE\u00a0EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY TIGHTENING ON REAL ACTIVITY AND INFLATION CAN BE EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN IN THE COMING YEARS.\nDEUTSCHE BANK: WE HAVE CUT OUR EURO AREA 2024 GDP FORECAST TO 0.5% FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 1%.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: RATE HIKES ARE BEING TRANSMITTED FORCEFULLY TO CREDIT CONDITIONS.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: FINANCIAL STABILITY HAS PROVED ROBUST SO FAR.\nDoes this count as workplace bullying?\nEUROPEAN GAS FUTURES JUMP 20% ON EXPECTATIONS OF MORE DEMAND FROM ASIA.\nDEUTSCHE BANK: WE HAVE CUT THE 2024 GDP GROWTH FORECAST FOR THE UK TO 0.4% FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 0.8%.\nOIL LOADINGS FROM RUSSIA'S WESTERN PORTS HIT A 4-YEAR HIGH IN MAY - SOURCES.\nPOLL: CANADIAN HOME PRICES TO FALL MEDIAN 8.9% IN 2023 (VS 12% FALL IN THE MARCH POLL).\nPOLL: CANADIAN AVERAGE HOME PRICES TO RISE 2% AND 4% IN 2024 AND 2025, RESPECTIVELY (SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS POLL).\nWHAT'S MOVING THE S&P THIS MORNING?

(Image 2)\n\nISM & Services PMIs\nISM services and S&P Services PMI are both closely watched economic indicators that provide insights into the performance of the services sector. However, they are published by different organizations and have some differences in methodology. Here's an overview of each:\n\nISM Services (Institute for Supply Management): The ISM Services Index, also known as the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, is published by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the economic activity in the non-manufacturing or services sector of the United States. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers from various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The survey covers areas such as new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories, and prices. The index is calculated by surveying the purchasing managers and assigning a diffusion index where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.\n\nAccording to Nieves from ISM, the historical relationship between the Services PMI and the overall economy suggests that the April reading corresponds to a 0.7-percent increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an annualized basis. This means that the services sector's growth, as indicated by the PMI, is expected to contribute positively to the overall economic growth.\n\nS&P Services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): The S&P Services PMI is published by S&P. It measures the economic activity in the services sector globally, covering multiple countries including the United States. The PMI is based on monthly surveys of purchasing managers in various services industries, such as business services, healthcare, and hospitality. The surveys ask respondents about changes in key business variables such as new business orders, employment, output, and prices. The index is calculated using a diffusion index methodology, similar to the ISM Services, where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.\n\nS&P services is expected to remain unchanged at 55.1 in expansionary territory as is the ISM Services at 52.4 compared to the prior of 51.9\n\nRBA Rate Decision\nAs the focus shifts from the US, we go to the opposite side of the world to Australia, where the RBA is expected to hold its Cash Rate at 3.85%, Tuesday at 12:30 AM ET.\nThis is the more difficult one to forecast with what the RBA might do at their upcoming policy meetings. In the past we had the RBA pause its rate on April 4th at 3.6%, which led to a delcine the the aussie dollar. \nTraders and economists at the the time held the notion that this could be where the RBA wil sit and wait to see how its hiking cycle effects the economy, and maybe continue to hold. However on May 2nd, the following meeting the RBA was expected to hold, but went for a 25 BPS hike instead. (Image 3) \n\nWhy?\nRBA had said in its Monetary Policy Statment that \"Inflation is still too high at 7%, and it will be some time before it returns to the target range\" and \"The board believes that additional tightening of monetary policy may be required\".\n\nOn May 14th NAB viewed RBA Cash Rate peak at least at 4.1%.\nTDS also beleive the RBA has more hikes up their sleeves.\n\nBoC\nNow we sail back to North America to Canada. The BoC is expected to hold rates at 4.5%, with the bank getting closer to it's inflation goal, but we're not there yet. Currently at 4.4%, it was higher than economists forecasted by 0.1%. That might not do it for the BoC to raise rates again, but there are other factors in the mix, too.\n\nTrade BoC with Tony Wednesday and Canadian Employment Friday LIVE HERE invidious.fdn.fr\/playlist?list=PL\u2026\nMORNING JUICE - US SESSION financialjuice.com\/News\/7450\u2026\nIRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE TO REOPEN DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS THIS WEEK - ISNA.\nIEA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BIROL: THERE'S AN IMBALANCE IN THE OIL MARKET IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR ALREADY, IT'LL WORSEN AFTER THE OPEC+ DECISION.\nIEA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BIROL: THE COUNTRIES THAT SUFFER MOST WITH HIGH OIL PRICES ARE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDIA, AND THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA.\nSECURED OVERNIGHT FINANCING RATE 5.07% JUNE 2ND VS 5.08% JUNE 1ST.\nRUSSIAN DEFENCE MINISTRY: TWO RUSSIAN STRATEGIC BOMBERS CARRIED OUT ROUTINE FLIGHT OVER BARENTS AND NORWEGIAN SEAS.\nCHINA'S TOP DIPLOMAT HAD PHONE CALL WITH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT'S ADVISOR.\nImportant: All Crypto Projects are a testing ground for what will be future features of Bitcoin.\n\nHowever as the next bull market gets closer, there will be LOTS of opportunity to trade the volatility of crypto using unusualactivity.live\nnope, just sharing another product we offer that provides volume and price alerts\nTURKEY\u2019S PRESIDENT ERDOGAN IS CONSIDERING APPOINTING ERKAN AS THE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR - TWO SOURCES.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: ITALY IS STRUGGLING TO SPEND EU RECOVERY PLAN CASH.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: TARGET 1.2%-1.4% GDP GROWTH FOR 2023.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINSTER GIORGETTI: ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT CURRENTLY PLANNING TO EXPAND DEFICIT.\nSAUDIS SEEK MORE OIL OUTPUT TRANSPARENCY FROM RUSSIA - ARABIYA.\nSAUDI ENERGY MINISTER: THE SAUDIS ARE FED UP WITH OPEC MEMBERS NOT MEETING OIL OUTPUT GOALS.\nITALY'S FINANCE MINISTER GIORGETTI: I DON'T SEE LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS FOR ITALIAN BANKS.\nMoving right now...\nWATCH LIVE - ECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE SPEAKS (VIDEO SAYS IT STARTS AT 10:00 AM ET)  multimedia.europarl.europa.e\u2026\nunusualactivity.live\nEFFECTIVE FED FUNDS RATE 5.08% JUNE 2, UNCHANGED.\n7 Day free trial: unusualactivity.live\nITALY'S ECONOMY MINISTER: I DO NOT PLAN A BANK WINDFALL TAX.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: PRICE PRESSURES REMAIN STRONG.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: UNDERLYING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES REMAIN HIGH.\nwhy? just alerts on spikes in volume and price.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THERE IS NO CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT UNDERLYING INFLATION HAS PEAKED.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: WAGE PRESSURES HAVE STRENGTHENED FURTHER.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: DECISIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE INFLATION OUTLOOK IN THE LIGHT OF THE INCOMING ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DATA, THE DYNAMICS OF UNDERLYING INFLATION AND THE STRENGTH OF MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: OUR RATE HIKES ARE BEING TRANSMITTED FORCEFULLY TO FINANCING CONDITIONS.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THE FULL EFFECTS OF OUR MONETARY POLICY MEASURES ARE STARTING TO MATERIALISE.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: THE\u00a0EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY TIGHTENING ON REAL ACTIVITY AND INFLATION CAN BE EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN IN THE COMING YEARS.\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: RATE HIKES ARE BEING TRANSMITTED FORCEFULLY TO CREDIT CONDITIONS.\nDEUTSCHE BANK: WE HAVE CUT OUR EURO AREA 2024 GDP FORECAST TO 0.5% FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 1%.\nDoes this count as workplace bullying?\nECB'S PRESIDENT LAGARDE: FINANCIAL STABILITY HAS PROVED ROBUST SO FAR.\nEUROPEAN GAS FUTURES JUMP 20% ON EXPECTATIONS OF MORE DEMAND FROM ASIA.\nDEUTSCHE BANK: WE HAVE CUT THE 2024 GDP GROWTH FORECAST FOR THE UK TO 0.4% FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 0.8%.\nOIL LOADINGS FROM RUSSIA'S WESTERN PORTS HIT A 4-YEAR HIGH IN MAY - SOURCES.\nPOLL: CANADIAN HOME PRICES TO FALL MEDIAN 8.9% IN 2023 (VS 12% FALL IN THE MARCH POLL).\nPOLL: CANADIAN AVERAGE HOME PRICES TO RISE 2% AND 4% IN 2024 AND 2025, RESPECTIVELY (SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS POLL).\nWHAT'S MOVING THE S&P THIS MORNING?

LE YUCHENG: CHINA IS WILLING TO EXPAND TRADE CO-OPERAITON WITH NEW ZEALAND, TAPPING POTENTIAL IN AREAS SUCH AS NEV AND INFRASTRUCTURE.\nRisk for The Week Ahead\n- RBA Meeting Minutes\n- BoJ Meeting Minutes\n- UK Inflation\n- Bank of England Rate Decision\n\nRBA\nThe RBA surprised the markets with a 25 BPS hike at its last meeting to 4.1% from 3.85%. The majority of traders were expecting the rate to remain unchanged, however, there were some economists that were looking at a potential 25 BPS hike. (Image 1)\n\nJune 19th, 9:30 PM ET, we receive the RBA Meeting Minutes of its June meeting. Here is the summary of that meeting\n\nInflation in Australia is at 7%, still high despite reaching its peak. The central bank is raising interest rates to restore confidence and bring inflation back to the target range. High inflation affects people's lives, damages the economy, and worsens inequality. The labor market has eased, and while wages have grown, household spending is slowing. Uncertainties in the global economy and housing market add to the challenges. The central bank will closely monitor the situation and take necessary actions to return inflation to the target range.\n\nWhat traders will need to consider is what does the RBA reveal in its Meeting Minutes that would have led to the hike.\n\nHere is what some investment banks expect for the RBA to do in the future, which might give some further hints as to what was discussed in the meeting.\n\nJune 7th - Goldman Sachs\nGoldman Sachs now expects RBA to hike rate by 25 BPS in July, August, and September to a terminal rate of 4.85% vs 4.35% expected previously.\n\nCBA \nThey now see the RBA peak rate at 4.35%, most likely in August.\n\nBoJ\nThe BoJ continued with its monetary easing, which led to the yen declining after the rate decision. (Image 2)\n\nHere is a summary of what was said:\nThe Bank of Japan will keep 10-Yr Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields within a range of around plus or minus 0.5 percentage points and offer to purchase 10-year JGBs at a fixed rate of 0.5 percent every business day. To shape the yield curve according to its market operation guideline, the bank will continue large-scale JGB purchases and adjust the amount of purchases for each maturity.\n\nJapan's economy has shown signs of improvement despite past high commodity prices and a slowdown in overseas economies. Exports and industrial production have remained flat, supported by reduced supply-side constraints. Corporate profits are high, leading to moderate increases in business fixed investment and improved employment and income conditions. Private consumption has also increased moderately, although housing investment has been weak. Financial conditions are generally accommodative, but some firms continue to face financial weakness.\n \nThe year-on-year consumer price index (CPI) inflation rate has slowed due to lower energy prices but remains around 3.5% due to cost increases in imports. Inflation expectations have stabilized after rising. \n\nLooking ahead, Japan's economy is expected to recover moderately in fiscal 2023, driven by pent-up demand and a strengthening income-spending cycle. However, growth is likely to gradually decelerate, and CPI inflation is expected to slow down temporarily before picking up again as the output gap improves and inflation expectations and wage growth rise.\n\nUK Inflation\nInflation has been an aching pain in the backside for the BoE for a while. Headline inflation had been hovering around 10% for about 9 months or so. The last report saw a marked decline from 10.1% compared to the prior 8.7%. However, it did surprise economists who were expecting it to decline to 8.2%. This led to the pound strengthening and the expectation for the Bank of England would continue raising rates. (Image 3) \n\nPost the inflation report, banks weighed in with their view:\nCiti: We now expect two further BoE interest rate hikes, rather than one, and no cut in November after the inflation data.\n\nBofA Global Research now anticipates BoE to deliver 25 bps rate hikes in June, August and September and raises the terminal rate call to 5.25% vs 4.75%.\n\nCredit Suisse: We now expect the BoE to deliver 25 bps hikes in June and August, taking the BoE terminal rate forecast to 5.0% vs the 4.75% expected earlier.\n\nBoE\nThe Bank of England is expected to raise rates by 25 BPS this week.\nTRADE BoE RATE WITH US THURSDAY LIVE AT 6:30 AM TO FIND OUT MORE, HERE!\ninvidious.fdn.fr\/live\/uEZ5ZoetKGQ\nSPANISH CENTRAL BANK SEES DEBT-TO-GDP RATIO AT 109.7% AT END OF 2023, EASING TO 108% BY 2025.\nSPANISH CENTRAL BANK RAISES 2023 ECONOMIC GROWTH TARGET TO 2.3% FROM 1.6% TARGET 3-MONTHS AGO.\nSPANISH CENTRAL BANK SEES EU-HARMONISED INFLATION AT 3.6% IN 2024 AND 1.8% IN 2025.\nSPANISH CENTRAL BANK CUTS THIS YEAR'S EU-HARMONISED INFLATION FORECAST TO 3.2% FROM 3.7%.\nSPANISH CENTRAL BANK SEES 2023 BUDGET DEFICIT AT 3.8% OF GDP DOWN FROM 4.8% OF GDP IN 2022.\nSPANISH CENTRAL BANK SEES BUDGET DEFICIT AT 3.4% OF GDP IN 2024 AND 4.0% OF GDP IN 2025.\nGERMANY\u2019S CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: ENTIRE EXPORT BUSINESS TO CHINA SHOULD NOT BE PUT UNDER STATE SUPERVISION, SCREENING MUST BE LIMITED.\nRUSSIA RAISES CRUDE-OIL PROCESSING TO HIGHEST IN OVER 2 MONTHS.\nGERMANY\u2019S CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: ENTIRE EXPORT BUSINESS TO CHINA SHOULD NOT BE PUT UNDER STATE SUPERVISION AND SCREENING MUST BE LIMITED.\nCHINA FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL: ONE STATEMENT SHARED BY CHINA AND THE US IS STABILIZING THE RELATIONSHIP AND PREVENTING DOWNWARD SPIRAL.\nCHINA FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL: UNILATERAL SANCTIONS BY THE US IS ONE REASON FOR BLOCKING MILITARY TO MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS.\nCANADIAN RMPI MOM ACTUAL -4.9% (FORECAST -, PREVIOUS 2.9%) $MACRO\nCANADIAN PPI YOY ACTUAL -6.3% (FORECAST -, PREVIOUS -3.5%) $MACRO\nCANADIAN PPI MOM ACTUAL -1.0% (FORECAST -, PREVIOUS -0.2%) $MACRO\nCANADIAN PPI MAY 2023 FULL REPORT. www150.statcan.gc.ca\/n1\/dail\u2026\nBOE SELLS \u00a3769.9 MLN  OF BONDS IN AUCTION AND RECEIVES \u00a31.75 BLN BIDS, APF GILT SALE OPERATION COVER RATIO 2.28.\nUS NAHB HOUSING MARKET INDEX ACTUAL 55 (FORECAST 51, PREVIOUS 50) $MACRO\nUS NAHB HOUSING MARKET INDEX JUNE 2023 FULL REPORT nahb.org\/news-and-economics\/\u2026\nCRYPTO FEAR AND GREED INDEX: 47\/100 = NEUTRAL.\nCHINA: XI'S MEETING WITH BLINKEN WAS OUT OF COURTESY - TV.\nWTO PANEL: CHINESE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES ON JAPANESE STAINLESS STEEL ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH WTO RULES.\nEU WEIGHS OPTIONAL REVENUE CAP FOR RENEWABLES PRODUCERS.\nEU WEIGHS REVENUE CAP TO BE APPLIED UNTIL JUNE 30 2024.\nWHITE HOUSE: THERE IS NO TIMING YET ON THE BIDEN, XI MEETING.\nECB'S STOURNARAS: A FURTHER DECREASE IN INFLATION IS EXPECTED.\nECB'S STOURNARAS: I CANNOT EXCLUDE A FURTHER INTEREST RATE RISE, WE ARE DATA DRIVEN.\nITALY ECONOMY MINISTER: I AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT 2023 GDP GROWTH BUT OUTLOOK IN THE EU IS NOT FAVORABLE, WE WILL PAY A PRICE FOR WAR AGAINST INFLATION\nECB'S STOURNARAS ON KEEPING RATES AT A TERMINAL INTEREST RATE: IT MIGHT BE SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR AND DEPENDS ON DATA.\nECB'S STOURNARAS: WE ARE DEFINITELY CLOSE TO THE END OF INTEREST RATE INCREASES.\nBRENT CRUDE FUTURES SETTLE AT $76.09\/BBL, DOWN 52 CENTS, 0.68%.\nEU COMMISSION TO PROPOSE IN THE COMING MONTHS REINFORCING EXPORT CONTROLS ON DUAL-USE GOODS - EU DOCUMENT.\nECB'S STOURNARAS: THE INFLATION FIGHT SHOULDN'T TRIGGER A RECESSION.\nECB'S STOURNARAS: IT IS POSSIBLE TO END RATE HIKES IN 2023.\nWhat is your prediction on ETH price movement? ->","completion":"\n\n I don't see anything unusual, no prediction, sir. ###"}
