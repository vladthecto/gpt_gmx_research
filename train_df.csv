What does the JOLTS Report mean?

Job Openings: The increase in the number of job openings to 10.1 million indicates that there are a significant number of available job opportunities in the US. This can be viewed as a positive sign for job seekers, as it suggests a relatively robust demand for labor.

Hires: The fact that the number of hires changed little at 6.1 million suggests that there was relatively stable hiring activity during the reported period. While not a significant increase, it still reflects ongoing recruitment efforts by employers.

Separations: The decrease in total separations to 5.7 million indicates a decline in the number of people leaving their jobs. This can be a positive sign as it suggests improved job stability and a potential decrease in involuntary job losses.

Quits: The relatively stable number of quits at 3.8 million suggests that employees are not significantly changing their voluntary job termination behaviour. This could indicate a level of job satisfaction or confidence in finding alternative employment.

Layoffs and Discharges: The decrease in layoffs and discharges to 1.6 million indicates a decline in involuntary job losses. This could be a positive sign, suggesting a more stable labor market and potentially improving economic conditions.

How did the markets react?
- Despite the positive data the S&P 500 didn't follow the DXY. We hardly saw an initia reaction at all from the index compared to the dollar visually. (Figure 1)
 
- Gold, however did see a bigger reaction, as the DXY and gold have a strong de-colloration i.e. whenever the dollar strengthens, gold weakens as you're able to buy more gold with a stronger dollar

How will this effect the Fed's decision making?
- Although the Fed's main objective is to bring inflation back down to it's 2% target, jobs data, particularly the monthly data is still key.
 
- The reason being, if more jobs are added to the economy, the more opportunity there is for consumers to increase their spending rather than save. That in turn means, the Fed may have more work to do.

- Hence, you had US rate futures pricing in a 71% chance of a June rate hike, compared to the odds of 60% yesterday. (Figure 2)

- However, the reasoning behind the S&P 500's almost non-existant reaction initially could be because the Fed in the last FOMC signalled openness to a pause and removed the phrasing that it would continue raising rate, and good data might be good data, albiet the stronger pricing in of a rate hike in June.

We've already had Biden sign the debt deal over the weekend, two days before a default would occur, raising the debt ceiling to $31.4 trln and suspending the debt limit till 2025, whilst restricting government spending. (Image 1)

ISM & Services PMIs
ISM services and S&P Services PMI are both closely watched economic indicators that provide insights into the performance of the services sector. However, they are published by different organizations and have some differences in methodology. Here's an overview of each:

ISM Services (Institute for Supply Management): The ISM Services Index, also known as the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, is published by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the economic activity in the non-manufacturing or services sector of the United States. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers from various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The survey covers areas such as new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories, and prices. The index is calculated by surveying the purchasing managers and assigning a diffusion index where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

According to Nieves from ISM, the historical relationship between the Services PMI and the overall economy suggests that the April reading corresponds to a 0.7-percent increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an annualized basis. This means that the services sector's growth, as indicated by the PMI, is expected to contribute positively to the overall economic growth.

S&P Services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): The S&P Services PMI is published by S&P. It measures the economic activity in the services sector globally, covering multiple countries including the United States. The PMI is based on monthly surveys of purchasing managers in various services industries, such as business services, healthcare, and hospitality. The surveys ask respondents about changes in key business variables such as new business orders, employment, output, and prices. The index is calculated using a diffusion index methodology, similar to the ISM Services, where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

S&P services is expected to remain unchanged at 55.1 in expansionary territory as is the ISM Services at 52.4 compared to the prior of 51.9

RBA Rate Decision
As the focus shifts from the US, we go to the opposite side of the world to Australia, where the RBA is expected to hold its Cash Rate at 3.85%, Tuesday at 12:30 AM ET.
This is the more difficult one to forecast with what the RBA might do at their upcoming policy meetings. In the past we had the RBA pause its rate on April 4th at 3.6%, which led to a delcine the the aussie dollar. 
Traders and economists at the the time held the notion that this could be where the RBA wil sit and wait to see how its hiking cycle effects the economy, and maybe continue to hold. However on May 2nd, the following meeting the RBA was expected to hold, but went for a 25 BPS hike instead. (Image 3) 

Why?
RBA had said in its Monetary Policy Statment that ""Inflation is still too high at 7%, and it will be some time before it returns to the target range"" and ""The board believes that additional tightening of monetary policy may be required"".

On May 14th NAB viewed RBA Cash Rate peak at least at 4.1%.
TDS also beleive the RBA has more hikes up their sleeves.

BoC
Now we sail back to North America to Canada. The BoC is expected to hold rates at 4.5%, with the bank getting closer to it's inflation goal, but we're not there yet. Currently at 4.4%, it was higher than economists forecasted by 0.1%. That might not do it for the BoC to raise rates again, but there are other factors in the mix, too.

ISM & Services PMIs
ISM services and S&P Services PMI are both closely watched economic indicators that provide insights into the performance of the services sector. However, they are published by different organizations and have some differences in methodology. Here's an overview of each:

ISM Services (Institute for Supply Management): The ISM Services Index, also known as the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, is published by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the economic activity in the non-manufacturing or services sector of the United States. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers from various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The survey covers areas such as new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories, and prices. The index is calculated by surveying the purchasing managers and assigning a diffusion index where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

According to Nieves from ISM, the historical relationship between the Services PMI and the overall economy suggests that the April reading corresponds to a 0.7-percent increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an annualized basis. This means that the services sector's growth, as indicated by the PMI, is expected to contribute positively to the overall economic growth.

S&P Services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): The S&P Services PMI is published by S&P. It measures the economic activity in the services sector globally, covering multiple countries including the United States. The PMI is based on monthly surveys of purchasing managers in various services industries, such as business services, healthcare, and hospitality. The surveys ask respondents about changes in key business variables such as new business orders, employment, output, and prices. The index is calculated using a diffusion index methodology, similar to the ISM Services, where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

S&P services is expected to remain unchanged at 55.1 in expansionary territory as is the ISM Services at 52.4 compared to the prior of 51.9

RBA Rate Decision
As the focus shifts from the US, we go to the opposite side of the world to Australia, where the RBA is expected to hold its Cash Rate at 3.85%, Tuesday at 12:30 AM ET.
This is the more difficult one to forecast with what the RBA might do at their upcoming policy meetings. In the past we had the RBA pause its rate on April 4th at 3.6%, which led to a delcine the the aussie dollar. 
Traders and economists at the the time held the notion that this could be where the RBA wil sit and wait to see how its hiking cycle effects the economy, and maybe continue to hold. However on May 2nd, the following meeting the RBA was expected to hold, but went for a 25 BPS hike instead. (Image 3) 

Why?
RBA had said in its Monetary Policy Statment that ""Inflation is still too high at 7%, and it will be some time before it returns to the target range"" and ""The board believes that additional tightening of monetary policy may be required"".

On May 14th NAB viewed RBA Cash Rate peak at least at 4.1%.
TDS also beleive the RBA has more hikes up their sleeves.

BoC
Now we sail back to North America to Canada. The BoC is expected to hold rates at 4.5%, with the bank getting closer to it's inflation goal, but we're not there yet. Currently at 4.4%, it was higher than economists forecasted by 0.1%. That might not do it for the BoC to raise rates again, but there are other factors in the mix, too.

ISM & Services PMIs
ISM services and S&P Services PMI are both closely watched economic indicators that provide insights into the performance of the services sector. However, they are published by different organizations and have some differences in methodology. Here's an overview of each:

ISM Services (Institute for Supply Management): The ISM Services Index, also known as the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, is published by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the economic activity in the non-manufacturing or services sector of the United States. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers from various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The survey covers areas such as new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories, and prices. The index is calculated by surveying the purchasing managers and assigning a diffusion index where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

According to Nieves from ISM, the historical relationship between the Services PMI and the overall economy suggests that the April reading corresponds to a 0.7-percent increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an annualized basis. This means that the services sector's growth, as indicated by the PMI, is expected to contribute positively to the overall economic growth.

S&P Services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): The S&P Services PMI is published by S&P. It measures the economic activity in the services sector globally, covering multiple countries including the United States. The PMI is based on monthly surveys of purchasing managers in various services industries, such as business services, healthcare, and hospitality. The surveys ask respondents about changes in key business variables such as new business orders, employment, output, and prices. The index is calculated using a diffusion index methodology, similar to the ISM Services, where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

S&P services is expected to remain unchanged at 55.1 in expansionary territory as is the ISM Services at 52.4 compared to the prior of 51.9

RBA Rate Decision
As the focus shifts from the US, we go to the opposite side of the world to Australia, where the RBA is expected to hold its Cash Rate at 3.85%, Tuesday at 12:30 AM ET.
This is the more difficult one to forecast with what the RBA might do at their upcoming policy meetings. In the past we had the RBA pause its rate on April 4th at 3.6%, which led to a delcine the the aussie dollar. 
Traders and economists at the the time held the notion that this could be where the RBA wil sit and wait to see how its hiking cycle effects the economy, and maybe continue to hold. However on May 2nd, the following meeting the RBA was expected to hold, but went for a 25 BPS hike instead. (Image 3) 

Why?
RBA had said in its Monetary Policy Statment that ""Inflation is still too high at 7%, and it will be some time before it returns to the target range"" and ""The board believes that additional tightening of monetary policy may be required"".

On May 14th NAB viewed RBA Cash Rate peak at least at 4.1%.
TDS also beleive the RBA has more hikes up their sleeves.

BoC
Now we sail back to North America to Canada. The BoC is expected to hold rates at 4.5%, with the bank getting closer to it's inflation goal, but we're not there yet. Currently at 4.4%, it was higher than economists forecasted by 0.1%. That might not do it for the BoC to raise rates again, but there are other factors in the mix, too.

We've already had Biden sign the debt deal over the weekend, two days before a default would occur, raising the debt ceiling to $31.4 trln and suspending the debt limit till 2025, whilst restricting government spending. (Image 1)

OPEC+ decided to more or less remain unchanged in their output, but the Saudis came in clutch with an extra 1 mln BDP cut expected to start in July. (Image 2)

ISM & Services PMIs
ISM services and S&P Services PMI are both closely watched economic indicators that provide insights into the performance of the services sector. However, they are published by different organizations and have some differences in methodology. Here's an overview of each:

ISM Services (Institute for Supply Management): The ISM Services Index, also known as the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, is published by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the economic activity in the non-manufacturing or services sector of the United States. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers from various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The survey covers areas such as new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories, and prices. The index is calculated by surveying the purchasing managers and assigning a diffusion index where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

According to Nieves from ISM, the historical relationship between the Services PMI and the overall economy suggests that the April reading corresponds to a 0.7-percent increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an annualized basis. This means that the services sector's growth, as indicated by the PMI, is expected to contribute positively to the overall economic growth.

The index is calculated using a diffusion index methodology, similar to the ISM Services, where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

S&P services is expected to remain unchanged at 55.1 in expansionary territory as is the ISM Services at 52.4 compared to the prior of 51.9

This week seems like it will be a very quiet week in regard to major economic releases, or even sentiment.

We've already had Biden sign the debt deal over the weekend, two days before a default would occur, raising the debt ceiling to $31.4 trln and suspending the debt limit till 2025, whilst restricting government spending. (Image 1)

OPEC+ decided to more or less remain unchanged in their output, but the Saudis came in clutch with an extra 1 mln BDP cut expected to start in July. (Image 2)

ISM & Services PMIs
ISM services and S&P Services PMI are both closely watched economic indicators that provide insights into the performance of the services sector. However, they are published by different organizations and have some differences in methodology. Here's an overview of each:

ISM Services (Institute for Supply Management): The ISM Services Index, also known as the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, is published by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the economic activity in the non-manufacturing or services sector of the United States. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers from various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The survey covers areas such as new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories, and prices. The index is calculated by surveying the purchasing managers and assigning a diffusion index where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

According to Nieves from ISM, the historical relationship between the Services PMI and the overall economy suggests that the April reading corresponds to a 0.7-percent increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an annualized basis. This means that the services sector's growth, as indicated by the PMI, is expected to contribute positively to the overall economic growth.

S&P Services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): The S&P Services PMI is published by S&P. It measures the economic activity in the services sector globally, covering multiple countries including the United States. The PMI is based on monthly surveys of purchasing managers in various services industries, such as business services, healthcare, and hospitality. The surveys ask respondents about changes in key business variables such as new business orders, employment, output, and prices. The index is calculated using a diffusion index methodology, similar to the ISM Services, where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

S&P services is expected to remain unchanged at 55.1 in expansionary territory as is the ISM Services at 52.4 compared to the prior of 51.9

RBA Rate Decision
As the focus shifts from the US, we go to the opposite side of the world to Australia, where the RBA is expected to hold its Cash Rate at 3.85%, Tuesday at 12:30 AM ET.
This is the more difficult one to forecast with what the RBA might do at their upcoming policy meetings. In the past we had the RBA pause its rate on April 4th at 3.6%, which led to a delcine the the aussie dollar. 
Traders and economists at the the time held the notion that this could be where the RBA wil sit and wait to see how its hiking cycle effects the economy, and maybe continue to hold. However on May 2nd, the following meeting the RBA was expected to hold, but went for a 25 BPS hike instead. (Image 3) 

Why?
RBA had said in its Monetary Policy Statment that ""Inflation is still too high at 7%, and it will be some time before it returns to the target range"" and ""The board believes that additional tightening of monetary policy may be required"".

On May 14th NAB viewed RBA Cash Rate peak at least at 4.1%.
TDS also beleive the RBA has more hikes up their sleeves.

BoC
Now we sail back to North America to Canada. The BoC is expected to hold rates at 4.5%, with the bank getting closer to it's inflation goal, but we're not there yet. Currently at 4.4%, it was higher than economists forecasted by 0.1%. That might not do it for the BoC to raise rates again, but there are other factors in the mix, too.

This week seems like it will be a very quiet week in regard to major economic releases, or even sentiment.

We've already had Biden sign the debt deal over the weekend, two days before a default would occur, raising the debt ceiling to $31.4 trln and suspending the debt limit till 2025, whilst restricting government spending. (Image 1)

OPEC+ decided to more or less remain unchanged in their output, but the Saudis came in clutch with an extra 1 mln BDP cut expected to start in July. (Image 2)

ISM & Services PMIs
ISM services and S&P Services PMI are both closely watched economic indicators that provide insights into the performance of the services sector. However, they are published by different organizations and have some differences in methodology. Here's an overview of each:

ISM Services (Institute for Supply Management): The ISM Services Index, also known as the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, is published by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the economic activity in the non-manufacturing or services sector of the United States. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers from various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The survey covers areas such as new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories, and prices. The index is calculated by surveying the purchasing managers and assigning a diffusion index where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

According to Nieves from ISM, the historical relationship between the Services PMI and the overall economy suggests that the April reading corresponds to a 0.7-percent increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an annualized basis. This means that the services sector's growth, as indicated by the PMI, is expected to contribute positively to the overall economic growth.

S&P Services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): The S&P Services PMI is published by S&P. It measures the economic activity in the services sector globally, covering multiple countries including the United States. The PMI is based on monthly surveys of purchasing managers in various services industries, such as business services, healthcare, and hospitality. The surveys ask respondents about changes in key business variables such as new business orders, employment, output, and prices. The index is calculated using a diffusion index methodology, similar to the ISM Services, where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

S&P services is expected to remain unchanged at 55.1 in expansionary territory as is the ISM Services at 52.4 compared to the prior of 51.9

RBA Rate Decision
As the focus shifts from the US, we go to the opposite side of the world to Australia, where the RBA is expected to hold its Cash Rate at 3.85%, Tuesday at 12:30 AM ET.
This is the more difficult one to forecast with what the RBA might do at their upcoming policy meetings. In the past we had the RBA pause its rate on April 4th at 3.6%, which led to a delcine the the aussie dollar. 
Traders and economists at the the time held the notion that this could be where the RBA wil sit and wait to see how its hiking cycle effects the economy, and maybe continue to hold. However on May 2nd, the following meeting the RBA was expected to hold, but went for a 25 BPS hike instead. (Image 3) 

Why?
RBA had said in its Monetary Policy Statment that ""Inflation is still too high at 7%, and it will be some time before it returns to the target range"" and ""The board believes that additional tightening of monetary policy may be required"".

On May 14th NAB viewed RBA Cash Rate peak at least at 4.1%.
TDS also beleive the RBA has more hikes up their sleeves.

BoC
Now we sail back to North America to Canada. The BoC is expected to hold rates at 4.5%, with the bank getting closer to it's inflation goal, but we're not there yet. Currently at 4.4%, it was higher than economists forecasted by 0.1%. That might not do it for the BoC to raise rates again, but there are other factors in the mix, too.

This week seems like it will be a very quiet week in regard to major economic releases, or even sentiment.

We've already had Biden sign the debt deal over the weekend, two days before a default would occur, raising the debt ceiling to $31.4 trln and suspending the debt limit till 2025, whilst restricting government spending. (Image 1)

OPEC+ decided to more or less remain unchanged in their output, but the Saudis came in clutch with an extra 1 mln BDP cut expected to start in July. (Image 2)

ISM & Services PMIs
ISM services and S&P Services PMI are both closely watched economic indicators that provide insights into the performance of the services sector. However, they are published by different organizations and have some differences in methodology. Here's an overview of each:

ISM Services (Institute for Supply Management): The ISM Services Index, also known as the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, is published by the Institute for Supply Management. It measures the economic activity in the non-manufacturing or services sector of the United States. The index is based on a monthly survey of purchasing managers from various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and transportation. The survey covers areas such as new orders, employment, supplier deliveries, inventories, and prices. The index is calculated by surveying the purchasing managers and assigning a diffusion index where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

According to Nieves from ISM, the historical relationship between the Services PMI and the overall economy suggests that the April reading corresponds to a 0.7-percent increase in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on an annualized basis. This means that the services sector's growth, as indicated by the PMI, is expected to contribute positively to the overall economic growth.

S&P Services PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index): The S&P Services PMI is published by S&P. It measures the economic activity in the services sector globally, covering multiple countries including the United States. The PMI is based on monthly surveys of purchasing managers in various services industries, such as business services, healthcare, and hospitality. The surveys ask respondents about changes in key business variables such as new business orders, employment, output, and prices. The index is calculated using a diffusion index methodology, similar to the ISM Services, where values above 50 indicate expansion, below 50 indicate contraction, and 50 indicates no change.

S&P services is expected to remain unchanged at 55.1 in expansionary territory as is the ISM Services at 52.4 compared to the prior of 51.9

RBA Rate Decision
As the focus shifts from the US, we go to the opposite side of the world to Australia, where the RBA is expected to hold its Cash Rate at 3.85%, Tuesday at 12:30 AM ET.
This is the more difficult one to forecast with what the RBA might do at their upcoming policy meetings. In the past we had the RBA pause its rate on April 4th at 3.6%, which led to a delcine the the aussie dollar. 
Traders and economists at the the time held the notion that this could be where the RBA wil sit and wait to see how its hiking cycle effects the economy, and maybe continue to hold. However on May 2nd, the following meeting the RBA was expected to hold, but went for a 25 BPS hike instead. (Image 3) 

Why?
RBA had said in its Monetary Policy Statment that ""Inflation is still too high at 7%, and it will be some time before it returns to the target range"" and ""The board believes that additional tightening of monetary policy may be required"".

On May 14th NAB viewed RBA Cash Rate peak at least at 4.1%.
TDS also beleive the RBA has more hikes up their sleeves.

BoC
Now we sail back to North America to Canada. The BoC is expected to hold rates at 4.5%, with the bank getting closer to it's inflation goal, but we're not there yet. Currently at 4.4%, it was higher than economists forecasted by 0.1%. That might not do it for the BoC to raise rates again, but there are other factors in the mix, too.

RBA: GDP IS EXPECTED TO RISE BY 1.25% THIS YEAR AND BY AROUND 2% BY MID-2025.
RBA: THE BOARD IS CONCERNED THAT PREDICTIONS OF CONTINUED HIGH INFLATION WILL LEAD TO BIGGER RISES IN BOTH PRICES AND WAGES.
RBA: STATISTICS ALSO INDICATED THAT THE LABOUR MARKET REMAINS EXTREMELY TIGHT, WITH UNEMPLOYMENT HOVERING NEAR A 50-YR LOW.
RBA: THE ROAD TO A SOFT LANDING REMAINS A TIGHT ONE.

Risk for The Week Ahead
- RBA Meeting Minutes
- BoJ Meeting Minutes
- UK Inflation
- Bank of England Rate Decision

RBA
The RBA surprised the markets with a 25 BPS hike at its last meeting to 4.1% from 3.85%. The majority of traders were expecting the rate to remain unchanged, however, there were some economists that were looking at a potential 25 BPS hike. (Image 1)

June 19th, 9:30 PM ET, we receive the RBA Meeting Minutes of its June meeting. Here is the summary of that meeting

Inflation in Australia is at 7%, still high despite reaching its peak. The central bank is raising interest rates to restore confidence and bring inflation back to the target range. High inflation affects people's lives, damages the economy, and worsens inequality. The labor market has eased, and while wages have grown, household spending is slowing. Uncertainties in the global economy and housing market add to the challenges. The central bank will closely monitor the situation and take necessary actions to return inflation to the target range.

What traders will need to consider is what does the RBA reveal in its Meeting Minutes that would have led to the hike.

Here is what some investment banks expect for the RBA to do in the future, which might give some further hints as to what was discussed in the meeting.

June 7th - Goldman Sachs
Goldman Sachs now expects RBA to hike rate by 25 BPS in July, August, and September to a terminal rate of 4.85% vs 4.35% expected previously.

CBA 
They now see the RBA peak rate at 4.35%, most likely in August.

BoJ
The BoJ continued with its monetary easing, which led to the yen declining after the rate decision. (Image 2)

Here is a summary of what was said:
The Bank of Japan will keep 10-Yr Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields within a range of around plus or minus 0.5 percentage points and offer to purchase 10-year JGBs at a fixed rate of 0.5 percent every business day. To shape the yield curve according to its market operation guideline, the bank will continue large-scale JGB purchases and adjust the amount of purchases for each maturity.

Japan's economy has shown signs of improvement despite past high commodity prices and a slowdown in overseas economies. Exports and industrial production have remained flat, supported by reduced supply-side constraints. Corporate profits are high, leading to moderate increases in business fixed investment and improved employment and income conditions. Private consumption has also increased moderately, although housing investment has been weak. Financial conditions are generally accommodative, but some firms continue to face financial weakness.
 
The year-on-year consumer price index (CPI) inflation rate has slowed due to lower energy prices but remains around 3.5% due to cost increases in imports. Inflation expectations have stabilized after rising. 

Looking ahead, Japan's economy is expected to recover moderately in fiscal 2023, driven by pent-up demand and a strengthening income-spending cycle. However, growth is likely to gradually decelerate, and CPI inflation is expected to slow down temporarily before picking up again as the output gap improves and inflation expectations and wage growth rise.

UK Inflation
Inflation has been an aching pain in the backside for the BoE for a while. Headline inflation had been hovering around 10% for about 9 months or so. The last report saw a marked decline from 10.1% compared to the prior 8.7%. However, it did surprise economists who were expecting it to decline to 8.2%. This led to the pound strengthening and the expectation for the Bank of England would continue raising rates. (Image 3) 

Post the inflation report, banks weighed in with their view:
Citi: We now expect two further BoE interest rate hikes, rather than one, and no cut in November after the inflation data.

BofA Global Research now anticipates BoE to deliver 25 bps rate hikes in June, August and September and raises the terminal rate call to 5.25% vs 4.75%.

Credit Suisse: We now expect the BoE to deliver 25 bps hikes in June and August, taking the BoE terminal rate forecast to 5.0% vs the 4.75% expected earlier.

BoE
The Bank of England is expected to raise rates by 25 BPS this week.
